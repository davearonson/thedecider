<p>Did you think that George W. Bush was The Decider?</p>

<p>No, THIS is The Decider!</p>

<p>The Decider helps you make rational decisions, based on how the options rate
in various aspects, and how important those aspects are to you.</p>

<p>This is a very rough prototype.  The UI has not been polished at all, and I
am still tweaking the workflow.  The main change I have in mind is to have just
a single master Update button on a Decision's screen, plus let you rename it
from there.</p>
