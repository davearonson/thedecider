  <p>Did you think that George W. Bush was The Decider?</p>

  <p>No, THIS is The Decider!</p>

  <p>The Decider helps you make rational decisions, based on how the options
  rate in various aspects, and how important those aspects are to you.</p>

  <p>This is a very rough prototype.  The UI has not been polished at all, and
  I am still tweaking the workflow.  The main change I have in mind is to have
  just a single master Update button on a Decision's screen, plus let you
  rename it from there.</p>

  <p>Other planned features include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Following people (need not be bidirectional)</li>
    <li>Friending people (must be bidirectional)</li>
    <li>Making selected decisions visible to your friends, your followers, other members, or even non-members</li>
    <li>Copying someone else's decision to your account so you can play with it</li>
    <li>Feel free to suggest more!</li>
  </ul>
