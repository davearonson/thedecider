<p>Did you think that George W. Bush was The Decider?</p>

<p>No, THIS is The Decider!</p>

<p>The Decider helps you make rational decisions, based on how the options
rate in various aspects, and how important those aspects are to you.</p>

<p>This is a very rough prototype.  The UI has not been polished at all, and
I am still tweaking the workflow.  The main change I have in mind is to have
just a single master Update button on a Decision's screen, and let you
rename it from there.</p>

<p>Other planned features include:</p>

<ul style="list-style-position: inside;" comment="isn't inside the default?! why is it doing it outside-style if i don't do this?">
  <li>Guest account, so you can try it without creating an account</li>
  <li>Help</li>
  <li>Member directory (opt-in), with name and proximity searches</li>
  <li>Following people (need not be bidirectional)</li>
  <li>Friending people (must be bidirectional)</li>
  <li>Making selected decisions visible to your friends, followers, other members, or even non-members</li>
  <li>Seeing various lists of decisions, such as all you can see, just yours, just a given person's, etc.</li>
  <li>Copying someone else's decision to your account so you can play with it</li>
  <li>Sending me feedback</li>
  <li>More info about me</li>
  <li>Feel free to suggest more!</li>
</ul>
